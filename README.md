# Sustainable Product Scanner

## Description

The Sustainable Product Scanner is an innovative web application that falls under the Urban Tech category designed to empower consumers with information about the sustainability of products they purchase. By leveraging the power of barcode scanning technology and integrating with comprehensive product databases, this app provides users with instant access to crucial sustainability metrics.

Upon scanning a product's barcode, the application retrieves detailed information from the Open Food Facts API. It then processes this data to calculate three key sustainability scores:

1. Reusability: Assesses how easily the product or its packaging can be reused.
2. Recyclability: Evaluates the potential for recycling the product and its components.
3. Reducibility: Measures the product's overall environmental impact and potential for waste reduction.
